# MVC-PHP
A way of interpreting a PHP - MVC design with controllers, services, entities, repositories, models and views. This minimal example works with and without Ajax, including a database connection. Here as an example MySqli or Pdo, but the models are freely interchangeable. First set up database with *.sql file.
